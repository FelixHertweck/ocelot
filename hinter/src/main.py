"""Hinter MCP wrapper entry point.

Exposes Hinter's tools over Streamable HTTP — OpenHands' current, non-deprecated transport for
networked MCP servers. Register the resulting URL in a scenario's `mcp-servers.json` as
`{"hinter": {"url": "http://<VM9_IP>:<port>/mcp"}}`, the same `mcpServers` JSON convention this
repo's stdio entries already use, just with `url` instead of `command`/`args`.

Two MCP tools: `list_hint_categories()` + `ask_hinter(category, context)`. Categories are not a
fixed taxonomy — they're whatever content is loaded for the active scenario, so the agent must
discover them first. `ask_hinter` is session-scoped: each Streamable HTTP session (a real MCP
concept — server-assigned `Mcp-Session-Id`, client-echoed on every request) tracks its own tier
progression, starting at 1 and increasing by exactly 1 per successful call; a call past a
category's max tier for that session fails outright.

Also plain REST routes, alongside `/healthz` — not part of the MCP tool surface, for whoever is
operating/scoring a run: `GET /report` (a session's hint-request timeline, or every session's
merged when no `?session_id=` is given), `GET /sessions` (which session ids exist — the only way
to discover one, since it's an opaque server-minted UUID with no link to anything
human-recognizable), and `POST /reset` (wipe all session logs).
