"""Manual MCP client for exercising a running Hinter instance end-to-end.

Connects over Streamable HTTP twice — two independent client sessions, each with its own
server-assigned Mcp-Session-Id (a real Streamable HTTP concept: no manual header plumbing needed
here, the client SDK captures and echoes it automatically per connection). Both walk the same
category to its tier ladder's end and one call past it — proving (a) two sessions asking about
the same category both start fresh at tier 1 (isolation), and (b) a category exhausted for a
session errors on the next call rather than repeating the last hint. Finishes by cross-checking
the aggregate GET /report shows both sessions.

Usage:
    python mcp_client_test.py http://localhost:18080/mcp
